Todo:
1. Add an adaptive emergency feature to the rule-based agent, where if it the state indicates an intersection has
    a certain number of cars waiting on NS or EW than switch the light to the appropriate side
2. Add a "warmup" period which s really just a period at the beginning of each episode where the trained agent
    does not save the experiences as part of a rollout (its to make it so the env gets in a "normal" state before the agent
    starts training on it)


Multi-intersection (750 gen steps, 900 total steps):
- Rule-based: 1600 waitingTIme, 100 offset, 1.5 NS_mult
- Agent: 1830 waitingTime, 400 rollouts, 1024 rollout_length (or 400 rollouts, 2048 rollout_length)
